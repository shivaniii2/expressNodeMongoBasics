Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion, rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once. They are particularly useful for processing large files or network data, where memory constraints might be an issue.

The best example is data streaming on youtube and netflix .

There are four types of streams in Node.js:

Readable Streams: These streams allow you to read data from a source. Examples include reading data from a file, receiving data from an HTTP request, or reading data from a database query result.

Writable Streams: These streams allow you to write data to a destination. Examples include writing data to a file, sending data in an HTTP response, or inserting data into a database.
Duplex Streams: These streams represent both a readable and a writable stream. Examples include network sockets, where you can both send and receive data.

Transform Streams: These streams are a special type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on the input. They are particularly useful for data manipulation, such as compression or encryption.


Node.js provides a built-in module called stream that contains classes and methods for working with streams.


 each type of stream is an EventEmitter. EventEmitter is a core class in Node.js that allows objects to emit named events asynchronously. Streams utilize this EventEmitter pattern to notify subscribers (listeners) about various events that occur during the stream's lifecycle.

Here's how EventEmitter ties into the different types of streams:

Readable Stream: Readable streams emit events such as 'data', 'end', and 'error'.
The 'data' event is emitted whenever data is available to be read from the stream.
The 'end' event is emitted when there is no more data to be consumed from the stream.
The 'error' event is emitted if an error occurs while reading from the stream.

Writable Stream: Writable streams emit events such as 'drain', 'finish', and 'error'.
The 'drain' event is emitted when the writable stream can accept more data after previously being backed up.
The 'finish' event is emitted when all data has been flushed to the underlying system (e.g., a file or network).
The 'error' event is emitted if an error occurs while writing to the stream.



res.write() is a method in Node.js used to write data to an HTTP response. It allows you to send data to the client in chunks, rather than sending the entire response at once. This can be useful when you're dealing with large responses or when you want to start sending data to the client before you have all of it available.



In Node.js, when you create an HTTP server using the http module, you can listen for the 'request' event emitted by the server. The 'request' event is emitted whenever a new HTTP request is received by the server.

All this is considered streaming because you're reading and processing the data as it becomes available, rather than waiting for the entire file to be read before processing it. This allows for more efficient memory usage and faster response times, especially for large files.
