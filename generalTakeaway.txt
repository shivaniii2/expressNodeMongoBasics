Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy server, and load balancer. 
It is known for its stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. 
Web Server: Serving static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Reverse Proxy: Forwarding client requests to backend servers and serving as an intermediary between clients and servers.
Load Balancer: Distributing client requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.
API Gateway: Managing, monitoring, and routing API calls.



Brew Services is a macOS utility that allows you to manage background services using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS. Brew Services provides a convenient way to start, stop, and restart services that have been installed via Homebrew.

In my macOS nginx is installed through Homebrew so "brew services restart nginx" is the command to restart  nginx.
