JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing configuration data and structured data.

JSON data is represented as key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other JSON objects.

To convert an object into JSON in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.stringify() method.
To convert JSON back into an object in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.parse() method.



JSON is a language-independent data format, meaning it can be easily understood and parsed by many programming languages, not just JavaScript. This makes it a popular choice for exchanging data between different systems and platforms.
 JSON is commonly used for transmitting data between a client and server over a network, such as in web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a standardized format for representing structured data, allowing systems to communicate with each other seamlessly.
 
 JSON is a lightweight data format with minimal overhead, making it efficient for transmitting data over the network and storing data in memory or on disk.
  JSON is safer to parse than JavaScript objects, as it does not contain executable code. This helps mitigate security risks such as code injection attacks when processing untrusted data received from external sources.
