In MongoDB, the sort() method is used to specify the order in which the documents should be returned in the result set of a query. 
It allows you to sort documents based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order.


db.collection.find(query).sort(sortSpecifier)


sortSpecifier: This parameter specifies the sorting order. It can be a single field or an object with multiple fields and their corresponding sort order.

Sorting Order:The sorting order can be specified as either ascending (1) or descending (-1). By default, the sort order is ascending if not specified.


for example :
db.books.find({}).sort({title : 1})

Above is executed a query to find all documents in the books collection and sorted them by the title field in ascending order (1).

The documents are sorted based on the title field in ascending order.
In MongoDB, string values are sorted in ascending order based on their Unicode code point values.Lower Unicode code point values come before higher ones.

Twilight"
Starts with the letter "T".
Unicode code point for "T" is 84.
"hello world"
Starts with the letter "h".
Unicode code point for "h" is 104.
"hero"
Starts with the letter "h".
Unicode code point for "h" is 104.


I am adding genres new field  with value [fantasy,magic] to all the documents of collection book.
Let us see how can i do that :
db.books.updateMany({},{$set : {genres :["fantasy","magic"]}})

I used the above command and tadow. 
updateMany({}, { $set: { newField: "value" } }): This command updates all documents in the collection by setting the value of the new field (newField) to the specified value (value). The {} filter targets all documents in the collection.
