Indexes in MongoDB are special data structures that store a small portion of the collectionâ€™s data set in an easy-to-traverse form.
These structures support the efficient execution of queries and significantly improve read operations' performance.


LET US UNDERSTAND HOW ?
Consider a collection users with documents containing name and age fields. Without an index, a query to find users aged 25 would require scanning every document in the collection.

db.users.find({ age: 25 })


By creating an index on the age field.

db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })

this is gonna create an ascending index on age field .
MongoDB can quickly locate documents with age: 25 using the index, bypassing the need to scan the entire collection.
