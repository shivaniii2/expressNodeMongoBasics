In MongoDB, the $in operator is used within queries to specify that a field's value should match any value in a given array. This operator is very useful for filtering documents where the field value is among a specified list of values.


example : db.books.find({rating :{$in :["5","6"]}})

means return me all the documents that have reating field in range of 5 or 6 . 
remember the OR operator is also going to get us the same thing :

db.books.find({$or : [{rating :"5"} , {rating :"6"}]})

but ofcourse $in operator syntax is way simpler where we are just checking if the value of the field we are querying on is under the range of values given in the array.



There is also $nin operator which means not in that means opposite of $in :)

db.books.find({rating : {$nin : ["5", "6"]}})
