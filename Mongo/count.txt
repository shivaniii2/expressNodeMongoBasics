db.books.countDocuments()
You can always count the number of documents in a collection.

countDocuments method is used to count the number of documents that match a specified query criteria within a collection.
db.books.countDocuments({author:"chiku sharma"})


we can chain methods together one after the other like you can have find method and then count.
db.books.find({author:"chiku sharma"}).count()


so here we are counting what find is returning . But I guess countDocuments is way cooler than this as you can have a query directly.
