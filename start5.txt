Node.js provides the os module, which allows you to retrieve information about your operating system.

It's used to distinguish one computer from another in a networked environment. The hostname is typically assigned to a device during the operating system installation or configuration process.


Retrieve the total amount of system memory (in bytes) - os.totalmem()
Retrieve the amount of free system memory (in bytes) =os.freemem()
To convert byte into MB just divide bytes/(1024 * 1024)
For GB bytes/(1024 * 1024 * 1024)


The "total memory" of an operating system refers to the total amount of physical random-access memory (RAM) installed in the computer or device running that operating system. RAM is a type of volatile memory that the operating system and applications use to store data temporarily while the computer is powered on.



nodemon, a utility for Node.js that automatically restarts your Node application whenever changes are detected in your files. It's particularly useful during development to streamline the development workflow.
