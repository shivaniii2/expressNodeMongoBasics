The mongoose variable now holds the Mongoose object, which you will use to interact with MongoDB, define schemas, create models, and perform various database operations.
The new mongoose.Schema part calls the Schema constructor provided by Mongoose, which is used to create a new schema instance. 
The timestamps option in a Mongoose schema adds two fields, createdAt and updatedAt, to the schema. When the timestamps option is set to true, Mongoose automatically manages these fields for you. Hereâ€™s what happens:

createdAt: This field is automatically set to the date and time when a document is created.
updatedAt: This field is automatically set to the date and time when a document is last updated.
By using timestamps: true, you can track when documents are created and modified without having to manually manage these fields.



const Blog = mongoose.model('Blog', blogSchema); is used to create a Mongoose model from a schema. 
The first argument, 'Blog', is the name of the model. This name is used internally by Mongoose to manage the collection in MongoDB.
Mongoose automatically creates a collection named with the lowercase plural form of the model name. For 'Blog', it will create a collection named blogs in the MongoDB database.
The second argument, blogSchema, is the schema that defines the structure of documents in the blogs collection. This schema includes the fields, data types, validation rules, and options like timestamps.

The Blog variable - This variable is now a Mongoose model that you can use to create, read, update, and delete documents in the blogs collection.


So in short the defination for a model in mongoose is sumed up as :

In Mongoose, a model is a constructor compiled from a schema that represents a collection of documents in the MongoDB database and provides an interface for interacting with those documents.

if you remember the very basics then you should know that a constructor function in JavaScript is a special type of function used to create and initialize objects. When called with the new keyword, it sets up a new object instance with properties and methods defined within the constructor function.


Now if you will try to connect the defination of model where they say it is a constructor function that allows you to create instances of documents that adhere to the schema then you will get it for sure.



Its ok if you still want to be more clear about how it actually works altogether :

In Mongoose, a schema and a model are closely connected, where the schema defines the structure of the documents in a collection and the model provides an interface for interacting with those documents. Here's how they are connected:

A schema in Mongoose is an instance of the Schema class, and it defines the shape and constraints of documents within a MongoDB collection. It specifies the fields, their types, and any validation rules or default values.

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const userSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
});


A model is created from a schema using the mongoose.model method. The model acts as a constructor for creating and interacting with documents in the collection.


const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
The schema (userSchema in this example) defines the structure and rules for documents. It includes information like field types, required fields, default values, and validation rules.
The model (User in this example) is created using the schema. The model binds the schema to a specific MongoDB collection (users in this case, where the model name User is converted to the plural form users).
 When you create a new instance of the model, Mongoose uses the schema to validate and enforce the structure of the document.
 
const john = new User({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

The model provides methods to interact with the documents in the collection, such as saving a document to the database, querying for documents, updating documents, and deleting documents. These operations are performed in accordance with the schema's definitions and constraints.
